    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to complete
        its execution. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient, as it takes less time
        to process and produce results.</p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p>Space Complexity, denoted as O(n), measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a
        problem based on the input size (n). <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial in analyzing an algorithm's
        efficiency in terms of memory usage. Asymptotic notation, such as O(n), provides a concise way to express
        the upper bound on space requirements as the input size grows.</p>
